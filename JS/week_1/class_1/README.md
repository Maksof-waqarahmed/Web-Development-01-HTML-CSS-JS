# 🚀 JavaScript Introduction

## ❓ What is a Language?

A **language** is a way of communication. It uses words, signs, or rules so people (or machines) can understand each other.

* 🗣️ **Natural languages**: Human languages like English, Urdu, Chinese.
* 💻 **Programming languages**: Special languages made for computers. They follow strict rules so computers can understand and run them.

---

## 🖥️ What is a Programming Language?

A **programming language** is a way to talk to computers. With it, we can:

* 📝 Tell computers what to do.
* 🏗️ Build software and apps.
* ⚙️ Control hardware (like printers, phones, or sensors).

Examples: **JavaScript, Python, C, C++**.

---

## 🧩 Types of Programming Languages

Programming languages are of different types, based on how close they are to human thinking or machine instructions.

### 1️⃣ High-Level Languages

* ✍️ Easy to read and write.
* 👩‍💻 Similar to human language.
* 🌍 Work on many computers without changes.

**Examples:** JavaScript, Python, Java.

**Example in JavaScript:**

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('Rana'));
```

---

### 2️⃣ Mid-Level Languages

* 🔀 Mix of high-level and low-level features.
* ⚡ Can talk to hardware but also easy enough for humans.
* 🖥️ Used for system programming.

**Examples:** C, C++, Rust.

**Example in C:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello, Rana!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

---

### 3️⃣ Low-Level Languages

* 🧮 Very close to machine instructions.
* 🛠️ Hard to write but very powerful.
* 🎯 Directly controls the CPU and memory.

**Examples:** Assembly language, Machine code.

**Example (Assembly):**

```asm
section .data
  msg db "Hello, Rana!", 0xA
  len equ $ - msg

section .text
  global _start

_start:
  mov rax, 1   ; write
  mov rdi, 1   ; output
  mov rsi, msg
  mov rdx, len
  syscall

  mov rax, 60  ; exit
  xor rdi, rdi
  syscall
```

---

### 4️⃣ Very High-Level Languages (VHLL)

* 😌 Even easier than high-level.
* 📊 Made for specific tasks like data or maths.

**Examples:** SQL (databases), MATLAB (maths), R (statistics).

---

## 🔄 Language Translators

Computers only understand **0s and 1s (machine code)**. Translators convert our code into machine code.

### 🏎️ Compiler

* Changes the whole program into machine code before running.
* Makes an **executable file**.
* Very fast when running.

**Examples:** C, C++.

### ⚡ Interpreter

* Reads code **line by line** and runs it immediately.
* No executable file is made.
* Slower, but good for testing.

**Examples:** Python, JavaScript.

### 🛠️ Assembler

* Converts **assembly language** into machine code.
* Works line by line.

**Examples:** x86, ARM.

### 🚀 Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler

* Mix of both compiler and interpreter.
* Runs code quickly by compiling the most-used parts.
* Used in modern JavaScript engines like **V8** (Chrome, Node.js).

---

## Essential Tools for Every Programmer

To write and run code, programmers use some tools:

### 1️⃣ Code Editor 🖊️

* A place where we write code.
* Highlights code, shows errors, and helps with auto-complete.

**Examples:** VS Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++.

---

### 2️⃣ Language Translator 🌐

* Converts human code into machine code.
* Includes **compiler, interpreter, assembler**.

---

### 3️⃣ Linker 🔗

* Joins many small code files into one big program.

---

### 4️⃣ Loader 📦

* Loads the program into memory so the CPU can run it.

---

### 5️⃣ Debugger 🐞

* Helps find and fix errors (bugs).
* Lets you pause, check variables, and run step by step.

**Examples:** Chrome DevTools (JS), Node Inspector, GDB (C).

## ❌ Errors in Programming

Errors are problems in code that stop a program from running correctly. To make programs work, these errors must be fixed.

### 🧩 Types of Errors

1. **Syntax Error**
   Happens when the code breaks grammar rules of the programming language.
   🔎 Detected at compile time or when running code.
   ✅ Example: Missing semicolon, wrong brackets.

   ```js
   // ❌ Syntax Error
   console.log("Hello World"  // missing closing bracket
   ```

2. **Runtime Error**
   Happens while the program is running. The program compiles but then crashes or behaves unexpectedly.
   ✅ Example: Division by zero, using undefined variables.

   ```js
   // ❌ Runtime Error
   let x = 10 / 0; // Infinity
   console.log(undefinedVar); // ReferenceError
   ```

3. **Logical Error**
   The program runs without crashing, but the output is wrong due to incorrect logic.
   ✅ Example: Wrong formula or condition.

   ```js
   // ❌ Logical Error
   let marks = 50;
   if (marks > 100) { // wrong condition
       console.log("Pass");
   } else {
       console.log("Fail");
   }
   ```

## 🧰 Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

An IDE is software that provides all tools in one place to write, test, debug, and manage code.

### ✨ Key Features

* 🖍️ **Syntax Highlighting** → Highlights keywords, variables, and functions.
* 🧠 **Code Completion (IntelliSense)** → Suggests code snippets & methods.
* ❌ **Error Detection** → Detects mistakes in real time.
* 📁 **Project Management** → Organizes project files and folders.

💻 Example IDEs: **VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, Eclipse**

## 🌐 What is JavaScript?

JavaScript (JS) is a **lightweight, interpreted / just-in-time compiled programming language**.

* Used mostly in **web development**
* Can also run outside browsers → **Node.js, Apache CouchDB, Adobe Acrobat**
* Supports **first-class functions** (functions can be stored in variables, passed around, etc.)

### 🔧 Key Features

* Prototype-based
* Multi-paradigm → Object-Oriented, Imperative, Declarative, Functional
* Single-threaded & dynamic

* 🌐 Web Development (Frontend + Backend)
* 📱 Mobile Apps (React Native, Ionic)
* 🖥 Desktop Apps (Electron)
* 🎮 Game Development
* 🤖 AI & Machine Learning (TensorFlow\.js)

---

## ⚡ Types of JavaScript

### 🖥 Client-Side JavaScript

* Runs in browsers
* Handles **DOM manipulation, events, UI updates**

```js
// Example: Client-Side JavaScript
const button = document.getElementById("clickMe");
button.addEventListener("click", () => alert("Button Clicked!"));
```

### 🖧 Server-Side JavaScript

* Runs on servers
* Handles **requests, responses, database queries**
* Common tool: **Node.js**

```js
// Example: Server-Side JavaScript (Node.js)
const http = require("http");
http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end("Hello from Node.js");
}).listen(3000);
```
