# 🧠 **FLOWCHARTS**

## 📌 **What is a Flowchart?**

A **flowchart** is a **visual diagram** that shows the **steps of a process** in order.
It uses **symbols** (shapes) to represent different operations.

A flowchart helps you understand:

* How a program works
* The order of operations
* Decisions inside a process
* Loops, repeating tasks, and conditions
* Inputs & outputs

Flowcharts are used before coding to organize thinking.

# 🟦 **Flowchart Symbols**

Below are the **standard flowchart symbols** used worldwide.

---

## 🔶 **1. Terminator (Start/End)**

**Shape:** Oval / Rounded rectangle
**Purpose:** Shows **Start** or **End** of the flowchart

```
🔹 Start
🔹 End
```

---

## ⬜ **2. Process / Action**

**Shape:** Rectangle
**Purpose:** Used for **calculations, actions, steps**

Example steps:

* Add a number
* Print result
* Update variable

```
[ Add two numbers ]
```

---

## 🔷 **3. Decision / Condition**

**Shape:** Diamond
**Purpose:** Used when program needs to **choose between true/false**, **yes/no**, or **multiple choices**

Examples:

* Is age ≥ 18?
* Is password correct?

```
     [Age >= 18?]
        /    \
     Yes      No
```

---

## 🟪 **4. Input / Output (I/O)**

**Shape:** Parallelogram
**Purpose:** Shows **input** or **output**

Examples:

* Input age
* Display result

```
/ Input number /
\ Output result \
```

---

## 🟩 **5. Flow Lines / Arrows**

**Purpose:** Show **direction** of the flow.

```
Start → Step 1 → Step 2 → End
```

---

## ⬛ **6. Connector / Off-page Connector**

**Shape:** Small circle or pentagon
**Purpose:** Used when flowchart is long and needs continuation.

Useful for large diagrams.

---

## 🟧 **7. Predefined Process / Function Call**

**Shape:** Rectangle with double borders
**Purpose:** Used for **functions**, **sub-processes**, or **modules**.

Example:

```
[ calculateSalary() ]
```

---

## 🟨 **8. Document / Display**

**Shape:** Wavy bottom rectangle
**Purpose:** Shows printed output or document.

---

## 🟥 **9. Manual Input**

Shows data entered manually (e.g., typing in a form).

---

# 🧩 **Flowchart Rules (Must Follow for Professional Diagrams)**

✔ Flowcharts must start with **Start** and end with **End** <br>
✔ Arrows must show clear direction <br>
✔ Only **one arrow** should enter a process <br>
✔ Decision must have **two outputs** (Yes / No) <br>
✔ Keep flow from **top to bottom (best practice)** <br>
✔ Use consistent shapes <br>
✔ Avoid crossing arrows <br>
✔ Label decision outputs clearly <br>

# 📝 **How to Make a Flowchart (Step-by-Step Guide)**

### ✅ Step 1: Understand the problem

What are the steps? What needs to be done?

### ✅ Step 2: Identify inputs & outputs

* What comes IN? <br>
* What goes OUT? <br>

### ✅ Step 3: Break the process into smaller steps

Each step = one rectangle (process).

### ✅ Step 4: Identify decisions

Where do you need Yes/No or True/False?

### ✅ Step 5: Arrange steps in logical order

Top → bottom <br>
Left → right <br>

### ✅ Step 6: Add arrows to show flow direction

### ✅ Step 7: Use proper symbols

### ✅ Step 8: Review the diagram

Does it match the logic? <br>
Is anything missing? <br>

# 🧩 **Professional Tips for Clean Flowcharts**

✔ Use Microsoft Visio, Draw.io, Figma, Canva, Lucidchart <br>
✔ Maintain spacing <br>
✔ Keep all arrows straight <br>
✔ Use consistent colors <br>
✔ Keep diagram left-aligned or center-aligned <br>
✔ Avoid long sentences in shapes <br>
✔ Keep diamond decisions short (1 line if possible)

---

# 🧩 **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

❌ Too many lines crossing <br>
❌ No Start or End <br>
❌ Using wrong shapes <br>
❌ Writing code instead of simple steps <br>
❌ Arrows pointing in random directions <br>
❌ Large paragraphs inside shapes <br>
❌ Too many symbols — keep it simple

---

# 🧩 **Advantages of Flowcharts**

✔ Easy to understand <br>
✔ Best for beginners <br>
✔ Helps in debugging <br>
✔ Helps in algorithm planning <br>
✔ Improves documentation quality <br>
✔ Easier to explain logic to students or teammates <br>

---

# 🧩 **Disadvantages of Flowcharts**

❌ Hard to edit if logic changes <br>
❌ Large programs create huge diagrams <br>
❌ Not suitable for very complex algorithms <br>
