# 🧠 CSS Mid-Term Project — Individual Assessment

## 🎯 Overview

This **Mid-Term Project** evaluates each student’s understanding and creativity in **HTML and CSS** through an independently developed project.
Every student must **propose, design, and present** a unique idea using HTML and CSS within the given time frame.

The project will test your **technical knowledge, design thinking, and communication skills** — all essential qualities for becoming a professional front-end developer.

## 🧩 Project Rules & Workflow

### 🔹 Step 1: Idea Submission

1. Each student must **think of a unique idea** that can be built using **only HTML and CSS**.
   (You may take inspiration from online projects, but **exact clones will not be accepted**. Your idea must be **personally explained** and **clearly understood** by you.)

   > ⚠️ **Note:** Each idea must be unique. Once an idea is approved, **no other student can use or submit the same idea.**
2. Submit your **idea description** in the **Slack thread** created for Mid-Term Idea Submissions.
3. The instructor (**@Waqar Rana**) will **review** your idea:

   * ✅ **Approved:** Marked with a **✅ (Tick)** emoji.
   * ❌ **Rejected:** Marked with a **❌ (Cross)** emoji — you must submit a **new idea** for approval.
4. Only start working **after your idea has been approved**.

### 🔹 Step 2: Project Development

1. Once your idea is approved, begin building your project using **pure HTML and CSS**.
2. You may use **ChatGPT or online references**, but every line of code must be **understood by you**, as you’ll need to **explain it during the viva**.
3. You must **complete the project within the given deadline** —
   **late submissions will not be accepted** after the time limit.

### 🔹 Step 3: Submission Process

Follow the same standard process used in weekly assignments:

1. **Record a short video** showing:

   * Your **project design** and how it works.
2. **Deploy your project on Netlify** using your GitHub repository.
3. **Post on LinkedIn**:

   * Share your **demo video**.
   * Write a short caption about what you learned.
   * Add your **Netlify Live URL** and **GitHub Repository Link**.
   * Tag **@Waqar Rana** in your post.
4. Submit your **LinkedIn post link** in the **Mid-Term Submission Thread** on Slack.

### 🔹 Step 4: Presentation Day (Viva)

On presentation day, you will:

* Present your **live project** in front of the class.
* Explain your **idea, design process, and code structure**.
* Answer **questions** from your instructor and classmates about your work.
